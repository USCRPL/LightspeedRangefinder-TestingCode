## Lightspeed Rangefinder Testing Code Release

This repository is a public release of code used by RPL to complete qualification tests on the rangefinder radios.  This forms only a part of our codebase, but should help provide details about the exact procedures and radio settings used in the tests. 

This code is designed to be used with:
- [RPL's CC1200 driver](https://os.mbed.com/users/MultipleMonomials/code/CC1200/)
- [RPL's CC1200Morse library](https://os.mbed.com/users/MultipleMonomials/code/CC1200-MorseEncoder/)
- [Mbed OS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os)

This code is provided in "as is" status, taken directly from our codebase.  It is missing dependencies and will not work out of the box -- it's more meant as a starting place for one's own tests and codebase.  No refunds! :P
